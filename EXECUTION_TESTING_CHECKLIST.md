fetch('/api/execution?page=1&limit=5')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Planned:', d));

fetch('/api/execution/executed?page=1&limit=5')
  .then(r => r.json()) 
  .then(d => console.log('Executed:', d));

// Test filter functionality
const programFilter = document.querySelector('select[placeholder*="program"]');
if (programFilter) programFilter.value = 'HIV';
```

### Manual URL Tests

## üîß **If Issues Are Found**

### Common Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check network tab** for failed API requests  
3. **Verify imports** - ensure Tabs component is properly imported
4. **Check state management** - verify tab state updates correctly
5. **Validate API responses** - ensure data structure matches interface

### Quick Fixes:
- **Tabs not switching**: Check if `activeTab` state is updating
- **Data not loading**: Verify API endpoints are accessible
- **Filters not working**: Check if filter state is updating in `useQuery` dependency array
- **Buttons not working**: Verify click handlers are properly bound

This checklist ensures comprehensive testing of the execution module's tabbed interface functionality!
